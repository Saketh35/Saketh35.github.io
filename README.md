# Saketh Reddy's Personal Portfolio 🌟

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my personal portfolio—an online space where I share who I am, what I do, and the technologies I'm passionate about. Whether you're here out of curiosity, looking to collaborate, or just happened to stumble in, I'm glad you're checking it out!

## 🔍 About This Project

This is a simple, clean portfolio site I built to introduce myself as someone who’s really into Data Science, Machine Learning, Python, and Power BI. It's meant to be a snapshot of my skills and projects—something that speaks for me when I’m not around to talk about it myself.

It’s completely built with basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, so it’s lightweight, easy to modify, and works in any browser.

## ✨ Key Features

- A clean, responsive layout for showcasing my skills and background
- Direct links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and other platforms
- Easy-to-edit HTML so anyone can reuse or personalize it for their own portfolio
- Minimalist design with a focus on content over flash

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (for light interactivity)
- Git for version control
- GitHub Pages (optional for deployment)

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you’d like to view this portfolio or tweak it to make your own, here’s how you can do it:

### ✅ Prerequisites

All you need is a modern web browser! No special tools or packages required.

### 📦 Installation / Local Setup

4. **Customize (optional):**

    Feel free to edit the HTML/CSS to showcase *your* own skills and interests. It’s all in plain text—no frameworks or build tools involved.

## 🧠 Notes & To-Do

- ✅ Works smoothly in most modern browsers
- 🛠️ Still improving responsiveness on smaller screens (mobile tweaks are in progress)
- 💡 I'd love to add a dark mode toggle and some light animations in the future
